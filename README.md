# PROGRAMMERS (pre-game assignment): Clone the “2024-2025 Pre-Game” repository, open the project in Godot 4 (should have a single Sprite2D node of Jimi), add a new Sprite2D node with your own choice of image, and then push your changes.
# If you have specific questions on how to work with GitHub or Godot, ask Raymond, Jessica, or Matthew, or use any of the many YT tutorials online.
