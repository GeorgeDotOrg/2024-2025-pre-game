# PROGRAMMERS (pre-game assignment): Clone the “2024-2025-pre-game” repository, open the project in Godot 4 (should have a single ooeeoo.tscn with a Sprite2D node of Hatsune Miku), add a new Sprite2D node with your own choice of image, and then push your changes.
# If you have specific questions on how to work with GitHub or Godot, ask Raymond, Jessica, or Matthew, or use any of the many YT tutorials online.
